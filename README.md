FeupHUB is a project developed for a course in college and the main goal is to promote the sharing of information relative to courses in FEUP between students so that a student knows what to expect from a course. Only FEUP users can use the platform and there are pages for each Master's, and pages for each course of the Master's where users that are enrolled on that course can comment, upvote comments and talk about the course (materials, teacher, useful information). Users that are enrolled on a certain Master's can see the courses but cannot comment if they are not enrolled in it.
